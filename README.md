## Installation

### Exporting JAR

Run the following in the root directory of the repository to export the Maven project as a JAR file.

```sh
bash build-jar.sh
```

Navigate to the created `target` directory. You should find the generated JAR `fruitcropxl-config-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

### Deploying to Maven Central Repository

Ensure you have write access to the `io.github.fruitcropxl` Maven Central Repository namespace by configuring your `settings.xml` (located in `/home/<username/.m2/` on Linux) (see [Publishing By Using the Maven Plugin](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-portal-maven/)).

You may be prompted for a GPG key to sign the files. Please see how to [configure and distribute a public GPG key](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/gpg/). Remember to send your GPG key to `keyserver.ubuntu.com` to distribute it before use.

Run the following:

```sh
mvn clean deploy
```

Navigate to [Publishing Settings](https://central.sonatype.com/publishing/deployments) on the Maven Central Repository web interface. The deployment should be visible as either Pending or Validating.

Publish the deployment once its status has been changed to Validated.
